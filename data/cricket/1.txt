India has won 3 world cups in 1983, 2007 and 2011.
The Indian cricket team made its Test cricket debut in 1932 and has since advanced to be among the top
four test teams in the (ICC rankings) in each of 2005 to 2008. India won the ODI Cricket World Cup in 1983 and 2011. In other major International victories, Team India won the Twenty20 World Cup in 2007 and ICC Champions Trophy in 2002 and 2013."
Cricket was introduced to the Indian subcontinent by European merchant sailors in the 18th century, and
the first cricket club was established in 1792. India's national cricket team did not play its first Test match until 25 June 1932 at Lord's, becoming the sixth team to be granted Test cricket status. From 1932 India had to wait until 1952, almost 20 years for its first Test victory. In its first fifty years of international cricket, India was one of the weaker teams, winning only 35 of the first 196 Test matches it played. The team, however, gained strength in the 1970s with the emergence of players such as Gavaskar, Viswanath, Kapil Dev, and the Indian spin quartet.
India won its first World Cup in 1983, under the captaincy of Kapil Dev.[5] The '80s and '90s also saw the debut of Tendulkar, Ganguly, Dravid,Laxman and Kumble, considered to be among the greatest Indian players.
Ganguly's, captaincy is considered to be the turning point of Indian cricket as it saw great success and
became one of the dominant side of the sport, followed by the superb captaincy of MS Dhoni under whom India won its second World Cup in 2011, the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2007, and Champions Trophy in 2013. Currently, Rohit Sharma is the captain of all 3 formats – Test, ODI and T20I teams.
